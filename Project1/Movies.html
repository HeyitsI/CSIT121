<p>
	 I just enjoy zombie movies so much. It doesn't even matter what language its in or the budget or the reviews, I will still watch it. One thing that I do enjoy about this genre is the different takes of how a zombie acts in the film. In most films the zombies act different and you can turn into a zombie more ways then just getting bitten. The last film that I watched had zombie that would form in large groups and randomly stack items in between eating humans, very creepy.

	 My most watched zombie film would be a tie against the moive World War Z and a Train to Busan. An honorable mention would be the funny movie Shaun of the Dead
