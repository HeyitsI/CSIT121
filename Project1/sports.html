<p> This is the Atlanta Falcons, they are a nfl team and are well known for blowing a superbowl lead of 28-3 to tom brady. I started to root for this team because of the wide reciver Julio Jones and quarterback Matt ryan but now they are both off the team and I still watch the falcons play.  
	<br> <br>
	I'm a falcons fan. Being a fan of this team is not the best at times but I have Kyle Pitts and his memes so its okay for now.
